# Shipping Company Project


## Shipping-Company info
   ### This project uses some data structure to simulate a shipping company that contains three types of trucks (VIP, Special and Normal). Each truck has its own data ( Capacity, Checkup time, Speed and  Delivery interval ). Also there are three types of cargos (VIP, Special and Normal)  and the assignment criteria should be applied for all the ready un-assigned cargos on each hour 
  ### Simulation time is always expressed in Day:Hour.  Also it Simulates the changes in the system every hour, and every 24 hours, the days increment.
### The program takes an input file from the user to get all information it wants, and gives us an output file that contains all statistics and the details for all what happened.
### The program can run in one of three modes: interactive, step-by-step, or silent mode. When the program runs, it should ask the user to select the program mode.
